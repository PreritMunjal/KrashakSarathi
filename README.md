# Krashak Sarathi Application
Sustainable analytics platform for advanced farming & their business solution

### The Concept
Our Project name “Krashak Sarathi” will be an analytics platform, which gives the advanced analytics outcome for any specific farming location based on current environmental scenarios like humidity, temperature, soil condition, etc. The platform gives the best possible farming strategy that can be implemented for a more reliable farming season using applied Machine Learning to the observation data. It also helps you to understand the condition & best outcome from that farm for any specific crop so that the government or any farming-related financial company can estimate the benefit from the targeted location. 

This project comes with a suite of services, which helps increase the productivity of crops, without overexploitation of resources, thus, keeping in mind, a sustainable and bright future. This app will answer all the basic problems which are faced by Indian farmers:

- Surface and Ground Water Availability within their region
- Soil Health Card Data.
- Rainfall Forecast Data of their region.
- Advisory system for farmers to follow a particular cropping pattern based upon time of the year, geographical location, and keeping in view sustainable use of locally available water resources.
- Estimate the price value of their crop, before selling them into the market.
